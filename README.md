## ✨ About This Project

Ever struggled to *see* what a derivative means?  
Ever wanted to *feel* how integrals accumulate area?  

`calculus-1-matlab-lib` is a learning-focused collection of **MATLAB codes** designed to **visualize**, **simulate**, and **solve** core topics from **Calculus 1** — from limits and continuity to derivatives and integrals — in a way that's intuitive, interactive, and engaging.

> 💡 “Calculus is the language of change — and MATLAB helps us speak it visually.”

## 📚 What You’ll Find

- ✅ Clear and well-commented MATLAB scripts for Calculus 1 topics  
- ✅ Visualizations for limits, derivatives, integrals, and applications  
- ✅ Dynamic plots to build intuition  
- ✅ Modular structure to help both learners and teachers

---

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

- Students learning introductory calculus or MATLAB  
- Teachers who want better demos for classroom use  
- Visual learners who want to *see* the math  
- Anyone curious about the beauty of calculus 📊✨

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Calculus is everywhere — in physics, engineering, economics, biology.  
But too often, it’s taught with static symbols and lifeless formulas.

This project aims to:
- Make calculus visible 👁️  
- Help learners build deep intuition 🔍  
- Connect theory with visual understanding 🧠📈  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DuyetBKU/calculus-1-matlab-lib.git
   ```
2. Open any `.m` file in MATLAB.
3. Run, tweak, and explore — calculus comes alive through code!

## 🙌 Support & Contributions

We’d love to have your:
- ⭐ Star (if this helps your learning)
- 🐞 Issues (for bugs, math errors, or unclear visuals)
- 📥 Pull requests (new demos, fixes, or optimizations)

Let’s build a library where *math becomes meaningful* — together.

## ❤️ Final Words

> This is more than a project.  
> It’s a visual journey through one of math’s most powerful ideas.  
> A tool for every late-night learner and passionate teacher.

**If this library helps you understand calculus a little better,  
give it a ⭐ and share it with someone who’s learning too.**

Let’s turn equations into insight.  
Together. 📐✨
